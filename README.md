## 1. Analysis Phase

### 1.1 Define Key Concepts
- **Differential Drive**: It consists of 2 drive wheels mounted on a common axis, and each wheel can independently being driven either forward or backward.
- **Encoders**: It's a sensing device that provides feedback by converting motion into electrical signals that can be interpreted by some controllers.

### 1.2 Research High-Level Information
- **Overview of Differential Drive Systems**: The differential drive mechanism relies on adjusting the relative velocity of two wheels
  - When both wheels rotate at the same speed, the robot moves in a straight line.
  - If one wheel moves faster than the other, the robot turns towards the slower wheel.
  - Conversely, if the wheels rotate in opposite directions, the robot spins around its center, enabling rapid turns. 
- **Overview of Encoders**:
  -  Encoders send a feedback signal that can be used to determine position, count, speed, or direction. A control device can use this information to send a command for a particular function.
  - Encoders use different types of technologies to create a signal, including: mechanical, magnetic, resistive and optical – optical being the most common. In optical sensing, the encoder provides feedback based on the interruption of light. 
- **Types of Encoders Used in Robotics**: ***Absolute** and **Incremental*** encoders but what is the difference between them?
  - Encoders may produce either incremental or absolute signals
  - Incremental signals do not indicate specific position, only that the position has changed [High or Low] signals.
  - Absolute encoders, on the other hand, use a different “word” for each position, meaning that an absolute encoder provides both the indication that the position has changed and an indication of the absolute position of the encoder.
